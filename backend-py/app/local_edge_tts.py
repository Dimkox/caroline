"""In-process Microsoft Edge TTS (via the edge-tts package) -- ported from reforce's own
EdgeTTS.py (d:/REPO/reforce/EdgeTTS.py), Camerlengo's own hardened wrapper around the same
edge_tts library, rather than reinventing a thinner one here.

Replaces local_tts_server.py/local_tts_launcher.py's separate HTTP-server-in-a-subprocess
(2026-09-27, per explicit instruction, after a real incident): that whole subprocess+HTTP
indirection was ported as-is from the OLD Node.js backend (backend/src/localTtsServer.ts),
where it existed for a real reason -- Node.js has no way to call a Python library directly,
so a separate Python process bridged over HTTP was the only option. backend-py IS already
Python, so that reason no longer applies: this module is called directly, in-process, with
a normal `await`, no subprocess to launch/supervise, no HTTP round trip, and no second
asyncio event loop being created per call (the old server's do_POST did a fresh
`asyncio.run()` on its OWN worker thread for every single request).

That old subprocess's design also had no timeout at all on the underlying edge_tts call --
confirmed live, 2026-09-27: a stuck request just left a worker thread hanging forever
(ThreadingHTTPServer spawns one unbounded thread per connection), and after ~24 minutes of
real use in one session, every subsequent call started failing "Server disconnected without
sending a response" -- 0 of 14 real requests succeeded locally that session, every one
paying Camerlengo's own slow ai:tts fallback (20-97s each, even for a few words). This
module's real connect_timeout/receive_timeout (below) is exactly reforce's own fix for
that same failure mode, ported over rather than re-derived.

Bug fix (no exponential backoff): reforce's own EdgeTTS.py backs off exponentially between
retries (baseBackoffSec * 2**attempt) -- per this codebase's own standing rule ("every retry
mechanism in Caroline's backend is flat, never exponential, even when the original code
being ported used exponential backoff"), flattened to a fixed delay here.
